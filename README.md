# Youtube-downloader-using-flask
This is a project in flask, python to download youtube videos by pasting the link.
When you install this thing on your system, change the video saving path in the pytube download command.
Because the saving address is hard coded, would like someone to fix that.
People say it's simple, but was hard for me lol.
